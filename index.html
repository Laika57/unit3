  <!-- Paragraph #1 --->
      <p alt ="Paragraph #1"> The USSR(United Soviet Socialist Republics) was created via the October(Russian) Revolution, the Bolsheviks(Communist) party is based on socialism. The USSR is usually attributed with being the first communist country, but they were just socialist.Communism and Socialism focus on the workers, or the proletariat. The workers try hard to take down the bourgeoisie. Communism is practically the opposite of capitalism. The leader of the revolution was Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov. He was also known as Vladimir Lenin. He was the first leader of the Soviet Union.

  <h3 alt ="Role in WW2"> Their Role in World War 2 </h3>
  <!-- Paragraph #2 --->
  <p alt ="Paragraph #2">The Soviets role in the war was mostly being defeated and pushed back all the way to their capital(Moscow) then coming back in the cruel Russian winter and destroying the Germans. The Soviets surrounded Berlin and took the city. One quote by Stalin upon hearing of Hitler's suicide, was "So the bastard's dead? Too bad we didn't capture him alive!" Lots of people say that the only reason that the Germans fell to the Soviets was because of the Russian Winter. But it was mix of tactical mistakes and missing oil. <br>Also at the beginning of the war, the Soviets were majorly unprepared for the challenge of holding back the German blitzkrieg(Lighting War) A blitzkrieg is where the Germans very quickly rushed across the border using their fastest soldiers. They were mostly made out of panzers(tanks). But after a while and, after Stalin actually started responding to the outside world after his state of prolonged shock, they began putting up a defensive.

  <h3 alt="The Collapse"> The Collapse</h3>
  <!-- Paragraph #3 --->
  <p alt="Paragraph #3">Unfortunately or some and fortunately for others, the Soviet Union like all countries will, collapsed. The reason it collapsed was because the current actual president, Mikhail Gorbachev, was essentially useless and sped up the collapse with his pointless and slow to work reforms. Also they had started to lose control on Eastern Europe. They were making less and less money in oil and gas. Also their civilians had next to no food. There was a massive famine because they tried to push for industrialization.Also, Stalin's collectivist farm idea was a terrible one.Not to mention all the failures that came with living a Socialist state.In my opinion, the Soviet Union became doomed in the early years, Lenin had died and the one person he didn't want to be in office was now the dictator.Stalin ruined the Soviet Union with his collectivist farm policy that had killed over 20 million of his own people.Ironically, money was the thing that brought the down the Socialist Union.
